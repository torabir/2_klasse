# Jest Test Framework

This project uses Jest to test a function that checks whether a given year is a leap year. The tests cover the following cases:
- The year is a leap year.
- The year is not a leap year.
- The year is a negative number (not supported).
- The year is `null` or `undefined` (not supported).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. Node.js and npm must be installed on your system. You can download and install them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installing Dependencies
If you have already cloned the repository, it's a good idea to reinstall the dependencies to ensure everything works correctly.

1. Delete the `node_modules` folder if it exists and (re-)install:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules
   npm install

### Run test
    npm test
